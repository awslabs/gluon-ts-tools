    Add --sagetest-filters as option to pytest cli.

    By passing filters to pytest via the `--sagetest-filters` option the
    matched training jobs will be accessible via the `cli_fixtures` fixture
    when testing. The arguments to `--sagetest-filters` should have the
    following structure

    {<fixture_name>: <kwargs for `sagetest.Filter`>}

    Example:

    pytest --sagetest-filters {"foo": {"names": ["job-name"]}}

    Initializing pytest as above makes the `foo` fixture available in pytest
    as part of the `cli_fixtures` fixture. Example:

    def my_test(cli_fixtures):
        jobs = cli_fixtures['foo']
        ...
